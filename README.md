# hotwire-golang-website

This project provides some working examples using [Go](https://golang.org) the [hotwire/turbo](https://turbo.hotwire.dev/) library published by [basecamp](https://basecamp.com/). This is based on a great post about [Hotwire: HTML Over The Wire](https://delitescere.medium.com/hotwire-html-over-the-wire-2c733487268c) by [@delitescere](https://twitter.com/delitescere).

# Overview

This service illustrates how to use turbo to enable updates to a website using primarily service side code.

1. Uses [html/template](https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/) via my helper library [echo-go-templates](github.com/wolfeidau/echo-go-templates) which provides layout helpers, and embedded assets with [io/fs](https://pkg.go.dev/io/fs) for [views](views).
2. Uses [echo](https://echo.labstack.com/) library to simplify routing.
3. Uses a CDN to host all css / JS libraries [base.html](views/layouts/base.html).
4. Uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) to automatically bundle JS assets on startup using [echo-esbuild-middleware](https://github.com/wolfeidau/echo-esbuild-middleware) to serve them.

# Hotwire Turbo

In this site I have implemented:

1. [Turbo Drive](https://turbo.hotwire.dev/handbook/drive)
2. [Turbo Frames](https://turbo.hotwire.dev/handbook/frames)
3. [Turbo Streams](https://turbo.hotwire.dev/handbook/streams) with [Server Sent Events (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events) and [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket)
4. [stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/)

Most of the server side logic is in [hotwire.go](internal/server/hotwire.go).


# Prerequisites

* Go 1.13 or later with support for Go Modules, used to build the service.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 12 or later, which is only used to install our asset building dependencies.
# Running

To get this project running you need to setup some certificates, in my case I use https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert and there is a target in the makefile.

```
make certs
```

To start the service just run.

```
make start
```

For development you can use the following command, this will check for code updates and restart the service.

```
make watch
```

The service should be listening on https://hotwire.localhost:9443/
